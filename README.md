# PEAK Discord RPC Mod

Showcase your PEAK gameplay to your friends on Discord with this simple mod! The mod integrates Discord Rich Presence into the game, displaying your in-game activity directly on your profile. Your friends will know what level you're on, your current state, and how long you've been playing in real time.

## Key Features

- **Track your progress:** Displays your current biome, group size, and difficulty level (e.g., Peak, Ascent 1).
- **Show your status:** Friends can see your current state, whether you're alive, dead, or unconscious.
- **Real-time updates:** The rich presence updates automatically as you play.
